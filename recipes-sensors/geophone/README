This directory contains files used to build the geophone analyzer on an
embedded system running Linux via the Open Embedded framework (see
<http://www.openembedded.org> for details on the framework).

The recipe sets up a sensor system that works as follows:

A daemon invoked via systemd continuously reads the Geophone output via
the USB serial port and writes a timestamped log to
/var/lib/geophone/geophone.log.  The log is rotated by logrotate.

Every 15 minutes a cron script creates a heatmap image based on the
geophone log data.  The heatmap image is placed in the web server directory
in /www/pages/geophone, and the previous heatmap image is renamed to
include a timestamp.  Heatmaps older than seven days are deleted.

The embedded Linux system runs a web server on its assigned IP address and
provides a simple heatmap viewer at http://<ip-address>/view-geophone-image.pl.
